In the heart of Budapest's Jewish Quarter, abandoned buildings have been transformed into 'ruin bars' – eclectic venues filled with mismatched furniture, local art, and vibrant music scenes. The most famous, Szimpla Kert, pioneered this movement and now hosts live music ranging from traditional Hungarian folk to experimental electronic music. Each room offers a different atmosphere, from intimate acoustic spaces to courtyard areas where DJs spin until dawn. The unique aesthetic combines crumbling grandeur with creative repurposing, creating spaces where history and contemporary culture collide.\n\n**History**: The ruin bar phenomenon began in the early 2000s when Szimpla Kert opened in an abandoned factory, using recycled furniture and local art to create a unique atmosphere. The movement helped revitalize Budapest's Jewish Quarter, transforming neglected buildings into cultural hotspots while preserving their historical character.	{urban,alternative,diverse,historic}	\N	Europe	Hungary	Budapest	Budapest, Hungary	{af3c98a2-dde0-474b-8daa-4699f9c1399e,90ba5610-5640-48cb-9aa4-285a71ebfd66}	{af4caf56-cf2d-403d-a90f-40fbe71fd9c2,a8b86bd8-8c3d-4f4f-9da4-984b8d5338c7}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	47.49722	19.05944	\N	t

Spanning 11 days across the New Year period, Epizode transforms a pristine Vietnamese island into an electronic music paradise. Set on the white sands of Phu Quoc Island, the festival combines world-class techno and house music with stunning bamboo architecture and tropical scenery. Multiple stages operate around the clock, allowing attendees to dance at sunrise on the beach, relax in hammocks during the day, then continue into the night. The extended duration creates a unique temporary community where time seems to operate differently as the old year flows into the new.\n\n**History**: Launched in 2016, Epizode was created by the team behind Kazantip Republic, the legendary underground electronic music festival that originated in Crimea. The festival quickly established itself as Asia's premier electronic music destination, attracting an international crowd of devoted music fans and industry professionals.	{electronic,beach,island,immersive}	\N	Asia	Vietnam	Phu Quoc Island	Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445}	{7b89843b-42b9-402b-954d-fcb620224205,38501229-91af-4657-8226-d11f0223158f,4e93e76b-ca83-4cea-8d84-725b6d9de675}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2023-12-31	t	10.19611	103.96278	\N	t

Nestled in the mountains of Niigata Prefecture, Fuji Rock is Japan's largest outdoor music festival and one of Asia's most renowned. Despite its name (from its original location near Mt. Fuji), the festival now unfolds across the breathtaking landscape of Naeba Ski Resort. Multiple stages connected by woodland paths showcase everything from international headliners to Japanese underground artists. The combination of world-class music, stunning natural beauty, and meticulous Japanese organization creates an experience that manages to be both massive and mindful.\n\n**History**: Founded in 1997, Fuji Rock survived a disastrous debut (featuring the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing during a typhoon) to become Asia's premier music festival. After relocating to Naeba in 1999, the festival developed a strong environmental ethic while attracting world-class talent across genres.	{mountain,international,eco-friendly,diverse}	\N	Asia	Japan	Naeba Ski Resort	Naeba Ski Resort, Niigata, Japan	{40ed98cb-ec34-40b0-960e-cecf879e7e25,90ba5610-5640-48cb-9aa4-285a71ebfd66}	{e5f15b40-3722-499f-ab58-f0e1e4ef3a58,b711c430-1222-4c08-af0e-d79df52ca739}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2030-07-28	t	36.79778	138.795	\N	t

Set along the banks of the Nile River, Nyege Nyege has emerged as one of Africa's most vital music festivals, showcasing experimental electronic music from across the continent. The four-day immersive experience combines forward-thinking musical curation with the natural beauty of Uganda, creating a cultural melting pot where traditional African sounds collide with cutting-edge electronic production.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2015, Nyege Nyege (meaning 'the feeling of a sudden uncontrollable urge to move, shake or dance' in Luganda) has grown from a small gathering to an internationally acclaimed festival. Despite occasional controversies, it has become a crucial platform for emerging African electronic musicians and a celebration of the continent's diverse sonic landscapes.	{electronic,experimental,african,underground}	\N	Africa	Uganda	Jinja	Jinja, Uganda	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445,b81b53a7-4e5a-4df4-828e-16a7564529d0}	{129c4e08-0300-414b-88a0-8932568f4328,7c141c96-2402-45f1-a6f8-0c3de8673d97}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-09-15	t	0.43861	33.1975	\N	f

The festival combines international acts with local Malawian talent, creating a unique cultural exchange while contributing significantly to the local economy and tourism.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2004 by British-Malawian Will Jameson, Lake of Stars was created to promote Malawian arts and tourism. Over the years, it has grown to become one of Africa's most respected music festivals and has generated millions in revenue for the Malawian economy while showcasing the country's rich cultural heritage.	{"world music",beach,cultural,afro-fusion}	\N	Africa	Malawi	Lake Malawi	Lake Malawi, Malawi	{5ef84a25-d906-48a7-98ec-cac996156eef,2d75b0b9-148e-4077-879e-3d85adf44ce6}	{7b89843b-42b9-402b-954d-fcb620224205,d1750d93-c53d-4aff-89a4-f2f8375027c1}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-09-27	t	-14.03111	34.92111	\N	f

The event focuses on sustainability and community, with stages built from natural materials and powered by renewable energy. Dancing beneath stars that shine through the branches of thousand-year-old baobab trees creates an unforgettable experience.\n\n**History**: What began as a small New Year's gathering among friends has evolved into a cultural institution that brings together diverse communities while respecting the sacred forest land. The festival places a strong emphasis on environmental conservation and supports local communities through various initiatives.	{electronic,eco-friendly,transformational,cultural}	\N	Africa	Kenya	Kilifi	Kilifi, Kenya	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445}	{b711c430-1222-4c08-af0e-d79df52ca739,00d8bac2-f324-42c8-81ce-1d7a1639d556,d1750d93-c53d-4aff-89a4-f2f8375027c1}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-12-28	t	-3.63111	39.85	\N	f

The festival has maintained its personal touch while growing into an internationally recognized event known for its breathtaking location and commitment to supporting the local Bulgarian community.	{electronic,mountain,eco-friendly,immersive}	\N	Europe	Bulgaria	Rhodope Mountains	Rhodope Mountains, Bulgaria	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445}	{e5f15b40-3722-499f-ab58-f0e1e4ef3a58,b711c430-1222-4c08-af0e-d79df52ca739,4e93e76b-ca83-4cea-8d84-725b6d9de675}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-06-02	t	41.85944	24.84222	\N	f

One of the most famous and renowned opera houses in history, Teatro La Fenice ('The Phoenix') has lived up to its name by rising from the ashes of multiple fires.

The experience of attending a performance here, surrounded by centuries of musical history in the magical setting of Venice, is truly unforgettable.\n\n**History**: First opened in 1792, the theater's name reflects its remarkable resilience, having been rebuilt after fires in 1836 and 1996. Many important operas premiered here, including works by Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. The most recent reconstruction meticulously restored the theater to its original splendor.	{opera,classical,historic,elegant}	\N	Europe	Italy	Venice	Venice, Italy	{9daff449-0c3e-442f-a482-c8e77b8a9670,199df7dd-a397-4833-8ba6-3f6b3d6d9413}	{a8b86bd8-8c3d-4f4f-9da4-984b8d5338c7,002c83d8-644c-4f02-b808-f7501585c455}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-12-31	t	45.43361	12.33333	\N	f

Set against the otherworldly backdrop of Lake Perris and its distinctive rock formations, Desert Daze has earned a reputation as one of the most forward-thinking music festivals in America. The event blends psychedelic rock, experimental electronic music, and avant-garde art installations in a surreal desert landscape. The lakeside setting allows attendees to swim by day while enjoying mind-expanding musical performances at night under star-filled skies and elaborate light shows.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2012 by Phil Pirrone, Desert Daze began as a small event in the California desert before growing into a major alternative to more commercial festivals. Despite its growth, it has maintained its independent spirit and commitment to creating transformative experiences through carefully curated lineups.	{psychedelic,rock,experimental,immersive}	\N	North America	USA	Lake Perris	Lake Perris, California, USA	{eb3bc4dd-b81c-43b8-9f89-0a081f0e9a5b,692689d4-f578-4c2f-8bb0-984ff5dda9df,b81b53a7-4e5a-4df4-828e-16a7564529d0}	{4e93e76b-ca83-4cea-8d84-725b6d9de675}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-10-12	t	33.85734	-117.17509	\N	f

More than a festival, Burning Man is a temporary city that emerges from the dust of Nevada's Black Rock Desert for one week each year. This experimental community celebrates radical self-expression, self-reliance, and art through massive installations, mutant vehicles, and hundreds of sound camps playing every genre of music imaginable. From sunrise yoga sessions accompanied by ambient music to late-night techno sets on desert-stranded pirate ships, Burning Man offers countless musical experiences against the backdrop of an otherworldly landscape.\n\n**History**: Founded on San Francisco's Baker Beach in 1986 by Larry Harvey and Jerry James, Burning Man moved to the Black Rock Desert in 1990. From humble beginnings with 20 people, it has grown into a 70,000-person phenomenon while maintaining its core values of radical inclusion, decommodification, and leave no trace.	{transformational,art,electronic,experimental}	\N	North America	USA	Black Rock Desert	Black Rock Desert, Nevada, USA	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445,b81b53a7-4e5a-4df4-828e-16a7564529d0}	{00d8bac2-f324-42c8-81ce-1d7a1639d556,1dd5043d-fd59-4b59-9b33-d7565d0ee077}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2025-09-10 21:23:24.753817	2023-08-27	t	40.78361	-119.205	\N	f

More than a festival, Burning Man is a temporary city that emerges from the dust of Nevada's Black Rock Desert for one week each year. This experimental community celebrates radical self-expression, self-reliance, and art through massive installations, mutant vehicles, and hundreds of sound camps playing every genre of music imaginable. From sunrise yoga sessions accompanied by ambient music to late-night techno sets on desert-stranded pirate ships, Burning Man offers countless musical experiences against the backdrop of an otherworldly landscape.\n\n**History**: Founded on San Francisco's Baker Beach in 1986 by Larry Harvey and Jerry James, Burning Man moved to the Black Rock Desert in 1990. From humble beginnings with 20 people, it has grown into a 70,000-person phenomenon while maintaining its core values of radical inclusion, decommodification, and leave no trace.	{transformational,art,electronic,experimental}	\N	North America	United States	Black Rock Desert	Black Rock Desert, Nevada, USA	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445,b81b53a7-4e5a-4df4-828e-16a7564529d0}	{00d8bac2-f324-42c8-81ce-1d7a1639d556,1dd5043d-fd59-4b59-9b33-d7565d0ee077}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2023-08-27	t	40.78361	-119.205	\N	f

Perhaps the world's most improbable opera house, Teatro Amazonas rises from the heart of the Amazon rainforest like a Renaissance fever dream. Built during the rubber boom of the late 19th century, this pink-and-white domed marvel features materials imported from across the globe: Italian marble, French glass, and English steel. Today, it hosts not only classical performances but also contemporary Brazilian music and the experimental Amazonas Jazz Festival. The surreal experience of hearing music in this opulent venue while surrounded by the world's largest rainforest creates an unforgettable juxtaposition of human and natural grandeur.\n\n**History**: Inaugurated in 1896 at the height of the rubber boom that transformed Manaus into a center of wealth and extravagance, Teatro Amazonas symbolizes both the splendor and excess of the era. After years of neglect following the collapse of the rubber industry, the theater was carefully restored and now stands as a symbol of cultural resilience in the heart of the Amazon.	{classical,historic,opera,amazon}	\N	South America	Brazil	Manaus	Manaus, Brazil	{199df7dd-a397-4833-8ba6-3f6b3d6d9413,9daff449-0c3e-442f-a482-c8e77b8a9670,bbab1f1e-7d24-4d76-8eff-28a03f5e7d3b}	{a8b86bd8-8c3d-4f4f-9da4-984b8d5338c7}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	-3.13056	-60.02333	\N	f

The Brazilian edition of the legendary American festival, Lollapalooza Brasil transforms São Paulo's Autódromo de Interlagos (normally a Formula 1 racetrack) into a massive celebration of global music. With multiple stages featuring more than 100 artists across genres ranging from rock and pop to hip-hop and electronic music, the festival attracts over 300,000 attendees. The event showcases international headliners alongside the best of Brazilian talent, creating a cross-cultural exchange against the backdrop of South America's largest city.\n\n**History**: Launched in 2012 as part of Lollapalooza's global expansion, the Brazilian edition quickly established itself as the largest incarnation of the festival outside the United States.

Held in a 17th-century palace in the Rajasthani desert, Magnetic Fields creates a stunning juxtaposition of contemporary electronic music and ancient architecture. The festival transforms Alsisar Mahal into a wonderland where traditional Indian elements meet cutting-edge sound and visual art.

The festival features breathtaking architectural stages built from sustainable materials (including bamboo and recycled plastic), each hosting different musical genres from live bands and world music to electronic sets. Between performances, attendees can participate in workshops on permaculture, attend talks on environmental issues, practice sunrise yoga, or feast at farm-to-table banquets prepared by renowned chefs. Wonderfruit's ambitious scope creates a temporary community devoted to creative, sustainable living.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2014 by Thai entrepreneur Pranitan 'Pete' Phornprapha, Wonderfruit was designed as a catalyst for positive social change through the universal languages of art and music. The festival operates on a deep commitment to sustainability, using compostable materials, banning single-use plastics, and offsetting its carbon footprint.	{sustainable,immersive,wellness,diverse}	\N	Asia	Thailand	Pattaya	Pattaya, Thailand	{90ba5610-5640-48cb-9aa4-285a71ebfd66}	{5f6b9ecb-f3ea-477d-8b58-4f363dec6d46,4e93e76b-ca83-4cea-8d84-725b6d9de675,a1ad10d6-ec71-4d22-8843-5ea9cd2c02ce}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2018-12-14	t	12.76361	100.95278	\N	f

One of Japan's most unique musical experiences, this monthly event transforms the lower pathways of Kyoto's famous Fushimi Inari Shrine into an ambient music venue after the tourists have departed. As evening falls, subtle lighting illuminates the sacred vermilion torii gates that line the mountain paths, creating a mystical atmosphere for quiet contemplation and deep listening. Local and international ambient, classical, and traditional Japanese musicians perform respectful, contemplative sets that complement the spiritual nature of this 1300-year-old Shinto shrine.\n\n**History**: Created in 2018 as a collaboration between shrine officials and local musicians, the series aims to share the profound atmosphere of the shrine at night while introducing visitors to contemplative musical traditions. The program carefully balances respect for the sacred site with artistic expression, with a portion of ticket proceeds supporting shrine preservation.	{ambient,spiritual,traditional,unique}	\N	Asia	Japan	Kyoto	Kyoto, Japan	{39f36622-765f-4109-9ce4-b59f20002cf4,5787dd25-b4ee-41d5-8a9d-e25110719369,d57379da-d2f5-4e82-82d4-785ca66b12bb}	{f6842231-a2e8-4c28-a5c3-59248969127a}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	34.9675	135.77278	\N	f

This unassuming venue in Australia's tropical north has become legendary for showcasing both Aboriginal music and touring bands in an authentically Territorian atmosphere. The open-air beer garden allows music to be enjoyed under the stars during the dry season, while ceiling fans stir the humid air during the spectacular wet season. The club has been instrumental in bringing indigenous Australian music to wider audiences, regularly featuring pioneering Aboriginal rock, reggae, and traditional performers alongside international touring acts drawn to the Top End's unique character.\n\n**History**: Established in 1969 by railway workers, this community club evolved into one of Australia's most important venues for indigenous music. Despite its remote location, the Darwin Railway Club has become a must-play venue for artists touring Australia who seek authentic cultural experiences and appreciate engaged audiences.	{indigenous,intimate,tropical,authentic}	\N	Oceania	Australia	Darwin	Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia	{0494c7c1-e4ce-4c0a-9a51-0b8998e402ab,157342bd-0926-4097-8f51-ff3e545920de}	{6c31a625-b612-4388-aeef-918a2e453ebb,c1c182bf-acbf-4c15-96cc-c529f4908a98}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	-12.43083	130.83694	\N	f

This bohemian beach town's best-kept secret happens every second Sunday, when a rotating collective of musicians, sound engineers, and artists transforms a remote beach accessible only by a hidden trail into a day-long celebration of music and nature. Operating in a legal gray area with tacit local approval, the gathering begins at sunrise with ambient and acoustic performances that evolve throughout the day as the tide recedes, revealing natural rock formations that serve as impromptu stages. Solar-powered sound systems deliver crystal-clear sound while leaving minimal impact, and the event concludes with a silent disco after sunset to respect wildlife and nearby residents.\n\n**History**: Started in 2014 by a group of local musicians and environmental activists, Race on the Beach developed as an alternative to commercial music events, emphasizing community, creative expression, and environmental stewardship. The event operates on principles of leave-no-trace and contribution, with participants expected to help with setup, cleanup, and bringing food to share.	{beach,underground,community,eco-friendly}	\N	North America	United States	Encinitas	Encinitas, California, USA	{}	{7b89843b-42b9-402b-954d-fcb620224205,7c141c96-2402-45f1-a6f8-0c3de8673d97,f90390fa-7a0b-4e7d-abf8-21e90f2cee39,b711c430-1222-4c08-af0e-d79df52ca739}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	33.04667	-117.29583	\N	f

Housed in a 19th-century Universalist stone church, this intimate venue combines spiritual architecture with transcendent musical experiences. The original church features, including stained glass windows and wooden pews, create remarkable acoustics perfect for everything from folk and bluegrass to jazz and indie rock. The 225-capacity space creates an intense connection between performers and audience, with many musicians citing it as among their favorite places to play. The non-profit venue emphasizes community building through music, with regular events supporting local causes.\n\n**History**: Built in 1832, the building served as a church for over a century before being converted to a music venue in 1970. During the 1970s and 80s, it hosted early performances by artists who would become legends, including Phish and Bonnie Raitt. After closing in 2008, community efforts revived the venue in 2018 as a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving this unique cultural space.	{historic,intimate,acoustic,spiritual}	\N	North America	United States	Newmarket	Newmarket, New Hampshire, USA	{5787dd25-b4ee-41d5-8a9d-e25110719369}	{a8b86bd8-8c3d-4f4f-9da4-984b8d5338c7,6c31a625-b612-4388-aeef-918a2e453ebb,d712031f-66a8-4030-8c2e-ba770e230a6d}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	43.0825	-70.935	\N	f

The minimal white interior with touches of neon stands in contrast to the building's raw concrete exterior, while a spacious rooftop terrace offers panoramic views of the Saône River. The venue specializes in cutting-edge electronic music, hosting both international DJs and emerging local talent. The combination of exceptional sound design, thoughtful architecture, and progressive musical curation has established Le Sucre as one of Europe's most respected electronic music spaces.\n\n**History**: Opened in 2013 as part of the redevelopment of Lyon's docklands, Le Sucre was created to provide a dedicated space for electronic music within the broader cultural complex of La Sucrière. The venue's focus on quality programming over commercial appeal has built its reputation as an essential destination for electronic music enthusiasts and artists alike.	{electronic,industrial,modern,rooftop}	\N	Europe	France	Lyon	Lyon, France	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445,a9abca70-43c7-44a0-8b95-8efe4dfb76d2}	{31a5bd75-4ffc-4a8c-885c-9c3d97c76b61,7bf21792-6eed-44bb-9426-a3a5db5be56d}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	45.73417	4.8175	\N	f

Hidden beneath a conventional restaurant in Johannesburg's Braamfontein district, The Root is an underground jazz venue that has become the beating heart of South Africa's vibrant jazz scene. The intimate basement space features exposed stone walls, low ceilings, and a small stage that places the audience within touching distance of world-class musicians. The venue honors South Africa's rich jazz history while providing a platform for a new generation of artists pushing the boundaries of the genre. Beyond the music, The Root serves as a community space where political discourse and artistic expression intertwine, continuing South Africa's tradition of jazz as both entertainment and resistance.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2011 by a collective of musicians and activists, The Root was established to preserve South Africa's jazz heritage while creating economic opportunities for contemporary musicians. The venue draws inspiration from the legendary jazz clubs of Sophiatown that flourished before being destroyed during apartheid, creating a space where music continues to serve as both artistic expression and political commentary.	{jazz,underground,intimate,cultural}	\N	Africa	South Africa	Johannesburg	Johannesburg, South Africa	{9860f7bc-8c21-4354-a0f3-e6b910619f5c}	{7c141c96-2402-45f1-a6f8-0c3de8673d97,6c31a625-b612-4388-aeef-918a2e453ebb,d1750d93-c53d-4aff-89a4-f2f8375027c1}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	-26.19278	28.03778	\N	f

A former shipyard transformed into a sprawling cultural playground, NDSM Werf hosts some of Amsterdam's most adventurous musical events in its industrial spaces. The massive dry docks, towering cranes, and cavernous warehouses create dramatic backdrops for festivals, concerts, and underground raves. The venue's sheer scale allows for multiple simultaneous events, from intimate performances in converted shipping containers to massive electronic music festivals in the main hall. The raw, unfinished aesthetic and spirit of creative reuse have made NDSM a symbol of Amsterdam's approach to preserving industrial heritage through cultural repurposing.\n\n**History**: After the bankruptcy of the Netherlands Dock and Shipbuilding Company in 1984, the massive industrial complex fell into disuse before artists began occupying the space in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, the city had embraced this organic cultural development, officially designating NDSM as a cultural hotspot and supporting its transformation while preserving its industrial character.	{industrial,alternative,massive,waterfront}	\N	Europe	Netherlands	Amsterdam	Amsterdam, Netherlands	{af3c98a2-dde0-474b-8daa-4699f9c1399e}	{31a5bd75-4ffc-4a8c-885c-9c3d97c76b61,f8f052eb-3d30-4900-8d6a-bba187dfdc41,9643042f-6d1e-438b-8723-90dfb9351465}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	52.40167	4.89972	\N	f

A living piece of American jazz history, the Green Mill has operated continuously since 1907 and was once owned by Al Capone's henchman 'Machine Gun' Jack McGurn. The art deco interior remains largely unchanged since the Prohibition era, with vintage booths, a curved bar, and original artwork creating an authentically historic atmosphere. The club maintains strict traditions: audience talking during performances is discouraged, and the music takes center stage. Known for its late-night shows that often continue until 4 AM, the Green Mill offers everything from traditional jazz and bebop to poetry slams and contemporary improvisational music.\n\n**History**: Established in 1907, the Green Mill reached its heyday during Prohibition when it operated as a speakeasy frequented by Al Capone, who reportedly had a favorite booth with clear sightlines to both entrances. The venue has survived changing musical trends and neighborhood transformations to remain one of America's most authentic jazz clubs, with many of its original features intact.	{jazz,historic,traditional,late-night}	\N	North America	United States	Chicago	Chicago, Illinois, USA	{9860f7bc-8c21-4354-a0f3-e6b910619f5c}	{a8b86bd8-8c3d-4f4f-9da4-984b8d5338c7,f6842231-a2e8-4c28-a5c3-59248969127a,bb9d80db-f187-468d-a104-ebc4c96b381f}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2024-01-01	t	41.96944	-87.66	\N	f

With multiple stages showcasing pan-African talent, alongside crafts markets, food stalls, and camping areas, Bushfire creates a vibrant temporary community celebrating African creativity.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2007, MTN Bushfire has grown from a small local gathering to an internationally recognized festival attended by over 25,000 people from more than 60 countries. All festival proceeds support young orphaned and vulnerable children in Eswatini through the 'Young Heroes' organization.	{"world music",cultural,"socially conscious",african}	\N	Africa	Eswatini	Malkerns Valley	Malkerns Valley, Eswatini	{5ef84a25-d906-48a7-98ec-cac996156eef}	{d1750d93-c53d-4aff-89a4-f2f8375027c1,80167f97-62a8-436a-b124-f16f7563c103,129c4e08-0300-414b-88a0-8932568f4328}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2023-05-26	t	-26.50778	31.185	\N	f

Known as 'the most remote music festival in the world,' Festival au Désert brings together nomadic Tuareg culture with global music in the stunning setting of the Sahara Desert. Attendees experience traditional Tuareg music, desert blues, and international collaborations while sleeping in traditional tents under vast desert skies. The festival was founded to celebrate peace and cultural exchange in a region often affected by conflict.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2001, the festival was originally a celebration of peace following a rebellion in the 1990s. Due to security concerns in Mali, the festival has operated as a 'festival in exile' in recent years, with events held in different locations worldwide, while working toward a permanent return to its desert home.	{"desert blues",tuareg,traditional,"world music"}	\N	Africa	Mali	Essakane	Essakane, Mali	{101d46b3-17a4-40b5-8c53-876a6baf9fad,07068022-a745-46f9-a1aa-5521478d25b3,5ef84a25-d906-48a7-98ec-cac996156eef}	{f6842231-a2e8-4c28-a5c3-59248969127a}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2023-01-12	t	16.77889	-3.00917	\N	f

One of the world's most extraordinary examples of naïve art architecture, this palace was built single-handedly by rural postman Ferdinand Cheval over 33 years. Today, the fantastical structure hosts intimate concerts in a setting that can only be described as surreal. Performances take place in the garden or inside the palace itself, with the otherworldly architecture creating natural acoustics and an atmosphere that enhances the musical experience in unexpected ways.\n\n**History**: Between 1879 and 1912, Ferdinand Cheval collected stones during his daily postal rounds and built his dream palace by night. Inspired by nature, postcards, and magazines, he created a structure mixing influences from different cultures and his own imagination. Recognized by Surrealists like André Breton and declared a cultural landmark in 1969, the palace now hosts a summer concert series embracing its unique acoustics and atmosphere.	{unusual,intimate,artistic,acoustic}	\N	Europe	France	Hauterives	Hauterives, France	{}	{a55a4a78-9e05-4f6c-8af0-b4496d00e33d,6c31a625-b612-4388-aeef-918a2e453ebb,e84c626d-16a1-4dd9-93fa-dfea321438c0,d712031f-66a8-4030-8c2e-ba770e230a6d}	{281b50c8-8d92-4ebc-b0bf-ed39dff14dbb}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2022-07-21	t	45.25611	5.02833	\N	f

Held in a 17th-century palace in the desert state of Rajasthan, Magnetic Fields offers a unique blend of contemporary music and traditional Indian heritage. The magnificent Alsisar Mahal provides a spectacular backdrop for cutting-edge electronic music, with stages set in palace courtyards, rooftops, and the surrounding desert. By day, attendees can explore desert activities and cultural programs; by night, the palace transforms into a wonderland of sound and light.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2013, Magnetic Fields has established itself as India's most forward-thinking music festival. By bringing contemporary electronic music to a heritage property, the festival creates a unique dialogue between traditional Rajasthani culture and global music movements. The festival has been instrumental in nurturing India's growing electronic music scene.	{electronic,cultural,boutique,palace}	\N	Asia	India	Alsisar	Alsisar, Rajasthan, India	{8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445}	{d1750d93-c53d-4aff-89a4-f2f8375027c1,e734de53-36c3-4fb4-8ea2-9771abd9658e,bc9651d4-a7bf-498c-ae4e-606cad702602}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2017-12-15	t	28.31667	75.28333	\N	f

Set in the breathtaking mountains of Niigata Prefecture, Fuji Rock is Japan's largest outdoor music event, combining international headliners with domestic talent across multiple stages connected by scenic woodland boardwalks. Despite the name, the festival is no longer held at Mt. Fuji, but the mountainous setting creates a magical atmosphere, especially at the Field of Heaven stage surrounded by forest. The festival is known for its environmental consciousness and orderly atmosphere.\n\n**History**: First held at the base of Mount Fuji in 1997 (and moved to Naeba in 1999 after a typhoon), Fuji Rock has established itself as Asia's premier music festival. Drawing inspiration from Glastonbury Festival in the UK, Fuji Rock emphasizes both musical diversity and environmental sustainability, creating an experience that harmonizes with its natural setting.	{rock,electronic,mountain,eco-friendly}	\N	Asia	Japan	Naeba Ski Resort	Naeba Ski Resort, Japan	{692689d4-f578-4c2f-8bb0-984ff5dda9df,8df3084f-fee9-446d-9071-57dcc1590445}	{e5f15b40-3722-499f-ab58-f0e1e4ef3a58,b711c430-1222-4c08-af0e-d79df52ca739}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2030-07-28	t	36.80417	138.7911	\N	f

Held in the experimental desert town of Arcosanti, FORM offers an immersive weekend of music, art, and ideas in a visionary architectural setting. The festival utilizes the unique spaces of this urban laboratory, with performances taking place in amphitheaters carved from the desert, intimate domes, and cliff-side plazas. Limited to just 2,000 attendees, the boutique festival creates a genuine sense of community and participation.\n\n**History**: Founded in 2014, FORM broke the traditional festival model by initially requiring applications to attend (now open to all but with limited capacity). The festival takes place in Arcosanti, an 'urban laboratory' founded in the 1970s by architect Paolo Soleri to explore the concept of 'arcology' - architecture coherent with ecology.	{indie,experimental,intimate,architectural}	\N	North America	United States	Arcosanti	Arcosanti, Arizona, USA	{6f973b54-f37d-4180-9aa4-1201652ee323,b81b53a7-4e5a-4df4-828e-16a7564529d0,609b67dc-ebd6-44dd-be63-5adfa9cb4891}	{6c31a625-b612-4388-aeef-918a2e453ebb}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2014-05-12	t	34.34361	-112.10083	\N	f

Set on the stunning shores of Lake Geneva with the Alps as a backdrop, Montreux has expanded far beyond its jazz roots to become one of the world's most prestigious music festivals. While maintaining a strong jazz program, the festival now embraces genres from rock and pop to electronic and world music. The combination of breathtaking scenery, Swiss precision in organization, and free lakeside performances alongside ticketed events creates a unique festival atmosphere.\n\n**History**: Founded in 1967 by Claude Nobs, Montreux has hosted nearly every major jazz figure and countless legends from other genres. The festival is renowned for unexpected collaborations and marathon jam sessions. Several iconic live recordings have been made at Montreux, including Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water,' which references a fire that burned down the original casino venue in 1971.	{jazz,prestigious,lakeside,diverse}	\N	Europe	Switzerland	Montreux	Montreux, Switzerland	{9860f7bc-8c21-4354-a0f3-e6b910619f5c,24044059-c78b-418c-a246-dd19afccf116,03b57f43-5926-4101-9500-7b3cdf20baa8,90ba5610-5640-48cb-9aa4-285a71ebfd66}	{}	{ae09a4c5-9e5c-4a9c-a779-afc9702163e2}	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2025-09-10 21:41:19.805067	2016-07-01	t	46.43111	6.91056	\N	f
